Mars Data Scraping and Analysis
What You're Creating
This project involves scraping data related to Mars from various sources and analyzing it. There are two main deliverables for this assignment:

Deliverable 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News
In this part, you will scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles using automated browsing techniques. The scraped data will be stored in Python data structures and optionally exported to a JSON file.

Deliverable 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data
This part involves scraping and analyzing Mars weather data from a website. You will scrape the data using Beautiful Soup, assemble it into a Pandas DataFrame, analyze various aspects such as Martian months, atmospheric pressure, and Martian year duration, and export the DataFrame to a CSV file.


Instructions
Part 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News
Open the Jupyter Notebook named part_1_mars_news.ipynb.
Use automated browsing to visit the Mars news site.
Inspect the page to identify elements to scrape.
Extract titles and preview text of news articles and store them in Python data structures.
Optionally, export the scraped data to a JSON file.
Part 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data
Open the Jupyter Notebook named part_2_mars_weather.ipynb.
Use automated browsing to visit the Mars Temperature Data Site.
Inspect the page to identify elements to scrape.
Assemble the scraped data into a Pandas DataFrame.
Analyze the dataset to answer specific questions.
Export the DataFrame to a CSV file.
